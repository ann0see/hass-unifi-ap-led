This integration allows Home Assistant to control the **status LEDs** on UniFi Access Points (APs), including:

- üîÑ Turning the LED on/off via a `switch`
- ‚ú¥Ô∏è Flashing the LED for 2 minutes via a `button` 
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully configurable via the Home Assistant UI

> **Note** ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an early **Beta** release. In theory, it supports both UDMs and self-hosted controllers. However, I only have a self-hosted controller available for testing, so UDM support is unconfirmed.
