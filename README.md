This integration allows Home Assistant to control the **status LEDs** on UniFi Access Points (APs), including:

- üîÑ Turning the LED on/off via a `switch`
- ‚ú¥Ô∏è Flashing the LED for 2 minutes via a `button` 
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully configurable via the Home Assistant UI

> **Note** ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an early **Beta** release. In theory, it supports both UDMs and self-hosted controllers. However, I only have a self-hosted controller available for testing, so UDM support is unconfirmed.

---

## Installation

- Search for "UniFi AP LED Control" in HACS
- Install **UniFi AP LED Control**
- Restart Home Assistant

---

## Configuration

You will need:
- UniFi Controller IP/hostname
- Username and password (use a local account with no MFA for least risk). If an account has MFA enabled, it will fail.
- Site ID (usually `default`)

---

## Flash Button

Triggers the `locate` command to blink the AP LED for 2 minutes ‚Äî useful for physically identifying devices.

---

## Switch

Turns the AP's LED on or off.  
Note: This does **not** disable the actual Wi-Fi functionality.

---

## Security

- ‚ö†Ô∏è This integration allows you to disable SSL verification when connecting to the UniFi controller. If you do so, ensure your network is secure and that credentials are protected.
- You should not use your main ui.com account. Create a local account on your Controller for the Integration to use with no MFA enabled.
